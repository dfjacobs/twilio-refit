    <Description>Twilio API interface implemented using the Refit package.</Description>
    <PackageReleaseNotes>Using Refit to call the Twilio API provides several advantages over the existing twilio-csharp package.

1. This package only contains the methods needed for my projects, implemented for the latest versions of .Net and .Net Core.  The methods I use haven't changed in years, unlike the twilio-csharp package, which is updated every few weeks with new methods for Twilio products I'm not currently using.
2. This package splits the API into separate components, I can just include the interfaces I need for a particular project.
3. It does not use a single static HttpClient for all API calls, which makes it much easier to write unit tests.</PackageReleaseNotes>
